#TODO-on-steroids


##Background
I decided to create a TODO-app to improve my coding skills (sometimes it is good to go back one step). I tried to use the best of my ability to make the app fancy and with a lot of functionality.


##Technologies
* Isomorphic
* React/Redux
* Node
* ReactTransitionGroup
* Drag and Drop
* PostgreSQL
* Immutable, Lodash
* SCSS, PostCSS
* ESlint
* Stylelint


###!!NOTICE!!
**Still in Beta version - have some things to sort out**

1. Register User and save in database
2. Load 'todos' of the user
3. Update the menu depending on the status of the user
